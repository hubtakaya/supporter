For killing time and for hobby, I created some codes which helps begginer's study with some Programming tutorial services.

Helps for dotinstall tutorial "PHPとjQueryで実装する「もっと読む」".
> https://dotinstall.com/lessons/more_php_v2/21801

It's considerably recommendable for understanding "READ MORE" technique with php and jQuery, but tweeter API's page looks different from vedio so I created the mock for tutorial. Also, I created POST version while original tutorial shows the way with GET method.

For more and more prosperty of dotinstall services, I only published the codes which I created by own.
